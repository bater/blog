# About Me

Hi, I'm **Bater Chen**, a results-driven Senior Full-Stack Engineer with over 12 years of experience delivering scalable solutions across diverse industries. I'm passionate about delivering real user value with AI, crafted through tidy, maintainable code.

I've worked with a variety of languages over the years—starting with Java and Ruby, and currently focusing on **C#/.NET** and **Python** in my professional work. I spent six years living and working in **Osaka, Japan**, before returning to **Taipei, Taiwan** in 2024 to join a startup.

Over the past year, I've taken on a "firefighter" role within the team—switching between frontend, backend, and project management as needed. I currently lead the **backend team**, where I've focused on optimizing system performance, implementing DevOps best practices, and refactoring our codebase to be more modular and maintainable.

I consider **Sandi Metz** and **Kent Beck** my coding mentors. I'm passionate about **refactoring legacy code** and making messy projects clean and maintainable. I believe great software starts with great developer experience (DevEx), and I strive to build tools and systems that support that philosophy.
