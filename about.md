# About Me

Hi, I'm **Bater Chen**, a software engineer with over 10 years of experience.

I’ve worked with a variety of languages over the years—starting with Java and Ruby, and currently focusing on **C#** in my professional work. I spent six years living and working in **Osaka, Japan**, before returning to **Taipei, Taiwan** in 2024 to join a startup.

Over the past year, I’ve taken on a "firefighter" role within the team—switching between frontend, backend, and project management as needed. I currently lead the **backend team**.

I consider **Sendi Matz** and **Kent Beck** my coding mentors. I’m passionate about **refactoring legacy code** and making messy projects clean and maintainable. I believe great software starts with great developer experience (DevEx), and I strive to build tools and systems that support that philosophy.

I also maintain a curated guide on **code smells and refactoring techniques**, which you can check out here:
👉 [Smells to Refactorings](https://smells-to-refactorings.gitbook.io/smells)

Thanks for stopping by!
