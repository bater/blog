Blog about web technology, mainly about ruby. Another [bolg](http://ithelp.ithome.com.tw/users/20103651/articles), but it's all in mandarin.

Every programer might agree that writing a blog is important and useful, but the issue is hard to keep going.

For me, I tried to write in many different place with different framework, such as wordpress, blogger, pixnet and logdown. Current one is wrote by [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and host by github page. I wish it can be a longer one.

Btw, it's my first english blog, so if you find any mistake in my blog, please kindly let me know.

Here is my [resume](http://resume.bater.cf) and [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/baterchen/).
