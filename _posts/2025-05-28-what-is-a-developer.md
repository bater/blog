# If AI does the heavy lifting, can I still call myself a developer?

As a developer who has recently managed to publish a blog post nearly every day, I should feel accomplished. Yet, a quiet sense of guilt lingers. With AI tools streamlining my work—writing blog drafts, generating 90% of my code through tools like Copilot or Cursor—the process feels almost *too* effortless. The deliberate rhythm of crafting each sentence or line of code by hand now seems like a distant memory. This ease prompts a deeper question: If AI does the heavy lifting, can I still call myself a developer?

## The Ethics of AI-Assisted Creation

This dilemma reminds me of a concept from mountaineering: **oxygen-free climbing**. Elite climbers often forgo supplemental oxygen, not for lack of resources, but to test the limits of human endurance. In a documentary, one climber remarked, “If your only goal is to reach the summit, you could hire a helicopter. But then what’s the point?” Similarly, if AI generates most of my work—whether code or prose—am I truly creating, or merely directing?

I faced a similar question over a decade ago when I first learned Ruby on Rails. The framework’s scaffolding feature allowed me to build a basic blog with just a few commands. Even then, without AI, I wondered: *Is this still programming?* Today, tools like Copilot amplify that question. They write faster, anticipate needs, and fill in gaps with an almost magical precision. Yet, the core concern remains: When creation becomes so automated, what role do we play?

## Redefining Value Beyond Code

Perhaps the answer lies not in the act of coding or writing, but in the impact we create. A developer’s true worth isn’t measured by lines of code produced, but by the problems we solve and the value we deliver. Whether I’m debugging a system, designing a workflow, or crafting a blog post that resonates, the essence of my work lies in its purpose: *Did I create something meaningful? Did I help someone? Did I make something work?*

This perspective shifts the focus from tools to outcomes, emphasizing our uniquely human ability to understand and address real-world needs.

## A Future of Evolving Roles

One day, we might share bedtime stories with our children about a bygone era: “Before AI, human engineers used something called a *keyboard*—they typed every single line of code by hand.” Our kids will gasp in disbelief: “Wait, what? That’s how people used to code?” By then, the title of “developer” may have evolved into something new—perhaps creators, problem-solvers, or designers of logic and value.

Our tools will continue to change, and job titles may shift, but the core of what we do endures. We remain the ones who bring ideas to life, solve challenges, and deliver meaning through technology.

## Embracing Our Human Core

In an AI-driven world, our value as developers lies in our ability to go beyond automation. We define problems, shape solutions, and ensure that technology serves a purpose. The next time you question your role amidst AI’s capabilities, reflect on the impact you’ve made—whether through a system you’ve built, a team you’ve supported, or a user you’ve helped.

What does being a developer mean to you in this evolving landscape? I’d love to hear your thoughts in the comments.
