Blog about software technology. Build by [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

Another [bolg](http://ithelp.ithome.com.tw/users/20103651/articles), but it's all in mandarin.

To run this blog locally on your local device, first you need to make sure you have Ruby and bundler and then do `bundle install` to install the necessary Ruby gems.

Then run `bundle exec jekyll serve`, or `bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload` for liveload.
